---

## Step 4: Use in ChatGPT

### Example Conversation

**User**: "I want to create a scatter plot of my sales data"

**ChatGPT**: "I can help you with that! Please provide your data. You can paste CSV data directly or describe what you have."

**User**:
```csv
Date,Sales,Revenue,Profit
2023-01-01,1200,15000,3000
2023-02-01,1350,16500,3300
2023-03-01,1100,14000,2800
...
```

**ChatGPT**: [Calls upload_data tool]
"Great! I've uploaded your data. I see 3 columns: Date, Sales, Revenue, Profit with 12 rows. What would you like to visualize?"

**User**: "Plot Sales and Revenue over time"

**ChatGPT**: [Calls create_scatter_plot tool]
[Displays interactive chart with Sales and Revenue plotted against Date]

"Here's your time-series chart! Would you like me to:
- Add Profit on a secondary axis?
- Remove any outliers?
- Create additional visualizations?"

## Next Steps: Add More Features

To expand beyond the single chart type:

1. **Add correlation heatmap tool** in mcp_server.py
2. **Add multiple charts tool** to create separate charts
3. **Add re-scaling tool** for normalized comparisons
4. **Add export tool** to save charts as files

Example new tool:
```python
@mcp.tool()
def create_correlation_heatmap(
    dataset_name: str = "dataset",
    columns: str = ""
) -> list:
    """Create correlation heatmap"""
    # Implementation here
    pass
```
